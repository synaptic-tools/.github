# Synaptic Tools

Building open-source tools to enhance how we learn and retain knowledge. Just as synapses form stronger connections through repeated activation, our tools help learners build lasting understanding through evidence-based learning techniques.

## Our Mission

We create plugins, applications, and tools that implement proven learning methods like Spaced Repetition, Active Recall, and Elaborative Processing. Our goal is to make effective learning techniques accessible to everyone through open-source software.

## Our Projects

- Learning plugins for popular note-taking apps
- Standalone applications for optimized study
- Open-source libraries for learning technology
- Tools that bridge the gap between theory and practice in educational technology
